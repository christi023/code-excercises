# New Default Code Exercises

Some fun exercises to sharpen your JS skills.

The idea of the exercises is to implement all functions to make the tests pass. 

## How to use

1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run tests

Run all tests
```bash
npm test
```

OR

Run individual tests
```bash
npx jest 1.filter-person.test.js
```
to run that particular test.
